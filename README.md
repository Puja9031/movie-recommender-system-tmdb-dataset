### Movie Recommender System

**Overview:**
The Movie Recommender System is a web application built using Streamlit that provides movie recommendations based on user input.

**Features:**

1. **Movie Recommendations:**
   - Users can select a movie title from a dropdown menu.
   - Upon selection, the app recommends movies similar to the chosen title using a similarity matrix.
   - The recommendations are based on a precomputed similarity model that evaluates how closely related different movies are.

2. **Poster Fetching:**
   - For each recommended movie, the app retrieves and displays a poster image.
   - The app includes a retry mechanism to handle errors while fetching posters from the TMDb API, ensuring a smoother user experience even when network issues occur.

3. **User Interface:**
   - The app features an intuitive interface where users can interact with a simple dropdown menu to choose a movie and a button to trigger recommendations.
   - Recommended movies and their posters are displayed in a grid format, making it easy for users to browse through suggestions.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Includes robust error handling with retry logic to manage network-related issues when fetching movie posters.
   - Displays appropriate error messages if a poster cannot be fetched, maintaining a user-friendly experience.

5. **Footer:**
   - A fixed footer at the bottom of the page credits the developer, ensuring the projectâ€™s contributions are acknowledged.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Streamlit:** For building the web application interface.
- **Pandas:** For handling movie data.
- **Pickle:** For loading precomputed data such as movie details and similarity matrices.
- **Requests:** For making API calls to fetch movie posters.
- **Tenacity:** For implementing retry logic to handle API request failures.

**Usage:**
